        There should be proper planning of the food storage. Also, we should buy and cook only the needed amount of food. 
        Instead of wasting food in marriages and other functions, we can distribute them among hungry poor people. 
        There are lots of ways to avoid food wastage.
          <br></br>
          <br></br> There are many families across the world living without food. 
          Think about them and start feeding them whenever it is possible, instead of wasting it. 
          Food is for everyone, not for one.
